# InfraWatch

InfraWatch is the upstream organization containing repositories for the Red Hat project Service Telemetry Framework (STF).

STF is an OpenShift application that orchestrates several Operators to result in a monitoring solution for Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

The upstream documentation is generated from the https://github.com/infrawatch/documentation repository and is available at https://infrawatch.github.io/documentation. The downstream (product) documentation is available at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform

The main landing repository for deployment of STF is at https://github.com/infrawatch/service-telemetry-operator. Installation of STF is available from the Red Hat Operators CatalogSource on Red Hat OpenShift Platform within the OperatorHub panel.
